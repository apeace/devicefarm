# DeviceFarm

Alpha release: v0.0.2

## Install

[Click here](https://github.com/ride/devicefarm/releases/download/v0.0.2/devicefarm-osx) to download the `devicefarm` binary for OS X. Then complete the install by running:

```
mv ~/Downloads/devicefarm-osx /usr/local/bin/devicefarm
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/devicefarm
cp ~/Dropbox\ \(Ride\)/Engineering/DeviceFarm/devicefarm.json ~/.devicefarm.json
```

## Setup

You should have a `devicefarm.yml` config in your repo, [like this one](https://github.com/ride/ride-app-android/pull/1297).

## Features

Only Android instrumentation tests are supported at the moment.

### Run UI tests on DeviceFarm

You will need [access to AWS](https://github.com/ride/devops/blob/master/docs/aws-access.md) to view the results of the tests, view screenshots, etc.

```bash
# go into your android project
$ cd /path/to/ride-app-android/

# run tests. after a couple of minutes, you will get a URL
$ devicefarm run

```

### Update device pools

If you update your device pools in `devicefarm.yml` you can run tests on different sets of devices. See "List devices" below for how to find device names.

```bash
# go into your android project
$ cd /path/to/ride-app-android/

# if you checkout a branch, device pools will be tied only to that branch
# you can just use master/develop if you want, but you may have conflicts
# with others if they test on the same branch at the same time
$ git checkout -b my-test-branch

# now edit devicefarm.yml...
# you can change the default config, OR specify overrides for your specific branch

# now just create another run
$ devicefarm run
```

### List devices

This way you can find devices you want to add to your device pools.

```bash
# list all devices
$ devicefarm devices
Apple iPad Mini 2
Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 (WiFi)
...

# list all devices matching "mini"
$ devicefarm devices "mini"
Apple iPad Mini 1st Gen
Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini (AT&T)
...

# list all android devices matching "mini"
# there is also an --ios flag :)
$ devicefarm devices --android "mini"
Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini (AT&T)
Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (Verizon)
```

## Limitations, bugs & future work

This is an alpha release for testing. Work is ongoing to stabilize this feature set for version 1.0.

See our [issue tracker](https://github.com/ride/devicefarm/issues) for known bugs.

Right now only Android instrumentation tests are supported, and only command-line usage is supported.

Future work:

 * v1.0 - Stabilize the existing feature set, higher level of unit-test coverage, automated releases (continuous delivery through CI).
 * v1.1 - Update to latest version with `devicefarm update`.
 * v1.x - Integrate with Github.
 * v2.0 - Rework `devicefarm.yml` format, introduce support for iOS and additional test types.
